I liked how the article talked about the importance of really communicating with everyone on your team.
When it comes to designing something big, it's definitely important to not only talk to the fellow designers
and engineers but also the marketing people who know the product/company well.

I also like the note about sketching ideas before implementing. I've been trying to get more into rough
sketching with a pen and notepad, and it's been super helpful in just flushing out fresh ideas without
having to worry about how nice it looks. Visualization is so important when designing something big. 
Upgrading from rough sketches to more put-together wireframe designs is also a good idea. The tool the 
article linked, Omnigraffle, looks like a neat tool to use for wireframe designs!
